Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains all my relevant codes and models i have worked on as regards Machine Learning, achieving state of the art results and high performance metrics depending on the type of problem to be solved

See the descriptions of each  notebook below:


[Zindi Hack](https://github.com/E-wave112/ml_proj1/blob/master/DSNZINDI.ipynb) A notebook containing the Machine Learning Model i built during the  2020 DSN AI Mini Hackathon on the zindi platform


[WEATHER FORECAST](https://github.com/E-wave112/ml_proj1/blob/master/timeseries.ipynb) A time series forecsasting ARIMA model on predicting air quality over time. data set was obtained from the uci repository
