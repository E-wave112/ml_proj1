Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains all my relevant codes and models i have worked on as regards Machine Learning, achieving state of the art results and high performance metrics depending on the type of problem to be solved

See the descriptions of each  notebook below:


[Zindi Hack](https://github.com/E-wave112/ml_proj1/blob/master/DSNZINDI.ipynb) A notebook containing the Machine Learning Model i built during the  2020 DSN AI Mini Hackathon on the zindi platform


[WEATHER FORECAST](https://github.com/E-wave112/ml_proj1/blob/master/timeseries.ipynb) A time series forecsasting ARIMA model on predicting air quality over time. data set was obtained from the uci repository

[SENTIMENT](https://github.com/E-wave112/ml_proj1/blob/master/nlp.ipynb) A NLP based porject analyzing various user tweets and classifying their sentiment as either being positive or negative.

[POWER IN INDIA](https://github.com/E-wave112/ml_proj1/blob/master/tsaindia.ipynb) A notebook which involves the exploratory data analysis and visualization in order to gain insights on how the coronavirus pandemic affected power distribution in various indian cities

[ALL THINGS SPOOKY](https://github.com/E-wave112/ml_proj1/blob/master/spooknlp.ipynb) The sppoky identification notebbok involves the use of natural language processing and text classification to determine which of the three most versed literature writers in all things spooky (names here) wrote that particular phrase

[SPAM](https://github.com/E-wave112/ml_proj1/blob/master/spamclassifier.ipynb) A state of the art spam detection Machine Learning Model built with various algorithms such as Decision Trees,Random Forests, Support Vector Machines,Logistic Regression and K-Nearest-Neighbors
